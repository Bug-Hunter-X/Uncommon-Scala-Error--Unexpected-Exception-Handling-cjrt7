# Uncommon Scala Error: Unexpected Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Scala exception handling. The code appears to handle potential exceptions, but could be improved for clarity and robustness.

## Problem

The `MyClass` class attempts to prevent negative ages. However, this simple error handling is not robust in a larger application.  More sophisticated error management could be added for better reliability. 

## Solution

The solution demonstrates more comprehensive approaches to exception handling and error reporting in Scala.
